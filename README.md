# 🧠 AURA – Offline AI-Powered Personal Assistant (Local Device Intelligence)

### Your Data, Your Control, Your Assistant

## 📄 Abstract

**AURA** is an AI-powered offline personal assistant designed to protect users from unwanted digital activities while enhancing productivity. The system operates completely offline, ensuring privacy and giving users full control over their data. AURA automates key tasks like managing emails, filtering spam, handling financial records, and providing intelligent suggestions — all executed locally within the user’s device.


## ⚠️ Problem Statement

In today’s digital environment, users face constant exposure to spam, phishing attempts, fake job offers, and financial scams. Manually managing these tasks is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing AI assistants rely on cloud servers that can potentially misuse personal data. AURA solves this issue by offering a **secure, offline personal assistant** that functions entirely within the user’s device.


## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a **privacy-focused offline assistant** using Java and Android.
* Automate **email reading**, **spam detection**, and **task execution** based on user preferences.
* Offer **financial and job assistance** through local processing.
* Store and manage all user data **locally using encrypted databases**.
* Design a **modular architecture** that allows easy expansion.

## 🏗 Existing System vs Proposed System

### Existing Systems:

Assistants like **Google Assistant** and **Alexa** rely on cloud infrastructure, raising privacy concerns and limiting user data control.

### Proposed System:

**AURA** is designed to operate entirely offline, giving users complete ownership of their personal data and privacy-focused automation.

## 🧱 System Architecture

AURA is structured into three layers:

1. **Application Layer:** Handles the user interface and Android permissions.
2. **Logic Layer:** Manages local AI-based decision-making and automation logic.
3. **Data Layer:** Handles encrypted data storage and logs using SQLite.

## ⚙️ Module Description

* **User Profile Manager:** Captures and securely stores user data (personal, financial, health).
* **Email Handler:** Reads local messages or test data, filters spam, and executes user-defined actions.
* **Offline AI Engine:** Performs rule-based decision-making for automation.
* **Job & Finance Advisor:** Suggests suitable opportunities and investment options.
* **Security Module:** Encrypts and manages permissions for local data.
